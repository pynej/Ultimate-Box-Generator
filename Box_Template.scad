// Box Rounding

//supress_walls_y=[]; // These are the walls running along the Y axis. It should be an array of size [repeat_x-1][repeat_y].

// Mesh Settings
// To make rounded corners and no mesh use any `mesh_type` > 0 and set `strut_gap` to a high value.

// 1: Single direction mesh.
// 2: Two direction cross mesh and 90 degree angle to eachother.
// 3: Two direction mesh but mirrored around 90 axsis instead or rotated 90 degrees.
// 4: Calculate angle across the diagonal of each opening. You will also want to change `strut_gap` to a large number and set `strut_count_min=1`.
// 5: No mesh, empty wall.
// 6: Honycomb. Also set `strut_width=wall/4` and `strut_gap=wall*2`. To big of a `strut_gap` may fail to print. Other shapes can be generated with `mesh_fn` and reducing `mesh_inset_padding` may help.
//mesh_type=0; // Mesh type, see above.

// Lid Settings
// 0: No Lid. top may be rounded and can cause other rendering changes.
// 1: Lid that slides off in the x direction.
// 2: Lid with a snapped in hinge that rotates open
// 3: Lid that snaps down onto the box. Also need to change lid_height to around 1.5mm.
// 4: Stackable version of cover 1 there boxes slide into one another. You will need one cover for the last box. (Not tested)

//z_tolerance=0;   // Z tolerance can be tweaked separately, to make the top of the sliding lid be flush with the top of the box itself.
//extra_bottom=.15; // Extra bottm wall height to fit type 4 slider.
//hinge_inset=.75; // Size of the hinge connection.
//snap_inset=.25; // Amount of overhang for snaps to snap into place.
//snap_tolerance=tolerance; // You may need to add tolerance around lid and snaps to let them move freely.
//lid_offset=3;		// This is how far away from the box to print the lid
//lid_height=wall*2;  // Height of lid. Must be greater than wall width for a `lid_type=5` lid to work. On Lid 3 is the depth of the inset snap.
//lid_fn=40; // Increese if printing thicker walls.
//lid_alt_offset=false; // Move lid in X instead of Y for printing.

//Internal Structure (You may need to turn off `mesh_do_sides` or `mesh_do_bottom` for good results.)
// You can also use `make_wall()` to manually add your own walls.
// 1: Rounded bottom frame.
// 2: Hexegon bottom frame. (To make this shape perfect set `comp_size_deep` to the width between to edges of the tile and set `comp_size_x` or `comp_size_y` to this this: `comp_size_deep / sqrt(3)*2`.
// 3: Rough bottom for make bits sit unevenly. (Partial)
// 4: Verical rounding on cordner. Set `internal_size_deep` to `comp_size_deep` and `internal_size_circle` to the shortest `comp_size` for a circle.

// Some notes on complex prints:
/* OpenSCAD expereicne is required to do pretty much any type of customization or complex opperations. This will essentaily jsut make the containers within one larger object with a single lid. Alternatly multiple boxes could be reated and then joined together with translations to make a larger object with multiple lids. 
   Due to how variables are passed in OpenSCAD it can be tricky to get the parameters set on the parent box and child boxes as you want. It is best to use global variable assignmets to set the child box parameters, then pass overrides to the `make_box()` call yourself. (You have to also set `show_box=false;` if you ddo this.)
